# DevMinecraftMod
Dev's Minecraft Mod (DevMinecraftMod) is a mod for Gorilla Tag that brings aspects from Minecraft into the game.  
The mod uses Minecraft's 1.8.9 textures, but in a future update it will probably add more.    

## Credits
All credit goes to Mojang, Notch, and C418 for all the content used in the mod. All textures ripped from the Minecraft 1.8.9 JAR file and all sounds were recorded with additional software.
